- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel
- ðŸ‘€ I currently study Computer and Electronic Engineering at UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). 
    I'm coming to GitHub not just to expand my knowledge, but to dive into this exceptional world that is Computer Science.
    Now, at the start, I'm looking to focus on back-end area, but I have to admit that I'm not close to front-end or data analysis.
